# The F-test for Comparing Multiple Classifiers

The method of using the F-test for comparing two classifiers is somewhat loosely based on Looney's work.

Thus method can be used to compare two or more classifiers. And, in the context of the F-test, our null hypothesis is that there that there is no difference between the classification accuracies

A null hypothesis is a type of hypothesis used in statistics that proposes that there is no difference between certain characteristics of a population. In this case, we are trying to prove that there is no difference between the classification accuracies of the multiple classifiers, therefore, proving the null hypothesis.

In this work, we compare the accuracy of 5 different models, conducting the F test, and then test the null hypothesis:  

   - SVM Linear
   - SVM RBF
   - Linear Discriminant
   - KNN
   - Perceptron
